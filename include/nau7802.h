//
//  nau7802_enable_ldo() to use the internal LDO instead of the AVDD input pin.
//  nau7802_set_gain() to make use of PGA values besides 1, or bypass the PGA.
//  nau7802_set_pga_cap() if you have installed a capacitor between
//   Vin2N and Vin2P (disabling the second channel).
//  nau7802_set_bandgap_chop() to disable bandwidth chopping.
//  nau7802_export_clock() to export the clock on DRDY instead of the data
//   readiness signal.

// receive power from an internal LDO driven from DVDD. the default
// configuration is external AVDD. the LDO cannot drive higher than
// DVDD - 0.3.
//
// the greatest precision will be had by supplying a large AVDD (though
// this requires an equally large DVDD) with minimal noise. theoretically,
// the LDO might quiet a noisy DVDD compared to bringing DVDD directly
// into AVDD, but it might not. if using an ESP32 with a 3.3 switching
// input, either tie DVDD to AVDD (and leave the LDO disabled), or leave
// AVDD disconnected, and set NAU7802_LDO_30V.
